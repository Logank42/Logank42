## About me:
<sub>
Hey there. Im Logan Kirkpatrick. I am a current Junior at DRHS, and beginning a journey in cyber security and coding. I mainly use python as that is what I have been taught on, however I look foward to learning more. Taking classes in these subjects has increased my skills drastically and I am excited to see where it will go.
